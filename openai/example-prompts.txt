example prompts:

I'm the chief compliance officer and I want to know if our company is following our policies.
- Managers should not able to see their employees salaries in their HR system
- Super admins should have access to everything
- employees should be able to see their own salaries

The salary policy shouldn't have changed in the last 3 months. is this valid ? if not, can you provide details ?

Miguel left the company last year, remove all accesses!

Remove super admins access to check employee salaries
